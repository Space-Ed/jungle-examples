# jungle-examples

A repository of misc explanitory examples for the jungle framework
Currently very lackluster

 Examples are hosted at 
 jungleorganic.space

---

## Usage

just start up a static web server in the repository root, no other dependencies but uses jquery from the web.

## Future

eventually this should be built with a jungle based web framework, featuring all the core jungle packages. 
Likely that it will become npm installable, with the used wrapper libraries as dependencies.

In the more distant future it would be good to have an embedded editor and turorial to give a hosted app for a one stop jungle learning experience.

## Contributing

Very open to PRs - especially UI design.
